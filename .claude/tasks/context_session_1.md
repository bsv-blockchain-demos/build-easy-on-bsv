# BSV Torrent Implementation Session 1

## Task Overview
Building a BitTorrent clone with BSV micropayments using @bsv/sdk. Key requirements:
- HD wallet creation and management
- Payment channels between peers
- Micropayments per 16KB block (17 sats per block)
- Transaction batching for efficiency

## Key Decisions Made
1. Using BRC-42 Key Derivation instead of BIP32/BIP39 for enhanced privacy
2. Implementing ProtoWallet for internal wallet management (not WalletClient)
3. Creating dedicated modules for:
   - Wallet management with BRC-42
   - Payment channels with automatic settlement
   - Micropayment batching system
   - Peer-to-peer payment tracking

## Implementation Status
- [IN PROGRESS] Setting up wallet module with BRC-42 key derivation
- [PENDING] Payment channel implementation
- [PENDING] Micropayment batching system
- [PENDING] Integration with BitTorrent peer management

## Files Created/Modified
- Will create: lib/wallet/wallet-manager.ts
- Will create: lib/wallet/payment-channels.ts
- Will create: lib/wallet/micropayments.ts
- Will create: lib/wallet/types.ts

## Next Steps
1. Complete wallet manager implementation
2. Implement payment channel system
3. Create micropayment batching logic
4. Integrate with existing torrent functionality
