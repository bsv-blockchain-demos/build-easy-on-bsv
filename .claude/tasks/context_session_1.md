## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED ✅

### Files Fixed:
1. **app/contexts/bsv-wallet-context.tsx** - Complete rewrite with BRC-100 compliance
2. **app/stores/bsv-torrent-store.ts** - Fixed Zustand selectors to prevent infinite loops

### Key Changes Made:

#### BSV Wallet Context (BRC-100 Compliant):
1. **Correct Imports**:
   - `SetupClient` from `@bsv/wallet-toolbox/client`
   - `StorageIdb` from `@bsv/wallet-toolbox/client`
   - `PrivateKey` from `@bsv/sdk` for key generation

2. **Proper Wallet Creation**:
   - Uses `SetupClient.createWallet()` with correct parameters
   - Implements BRC-100 standard with `{ chain, rootKeyHex, active, backups }`
   - Generates random `rootKeyHex` using `PrivateKey.fromRandom()`
   - Uses `StorageIdb` for client-side storage

3. **BRC-100 Wallet Operations**:
   - `wallet.listOutputs()` for balance calculation and address management
   - `wallet.createAction()` for BRC-100 compliant transactions
   - Proper identity key management with `setupWallet.identityKey`
   - Persistent wallet storage with localStorage for wallet config

4. **State Management**:
   - Added `setupWallet: SetupWallet | null` to track full wallet setup
   - Added `identityKey` and `rootKey` for proper authentication
